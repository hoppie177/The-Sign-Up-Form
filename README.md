Hey!

This is a sign up form I coded and took part in learning about and messing with. Getting to learn CSS and JavaScript I began watching tutorials. This sign up form being a idiration of a tutorial one by Online Forms on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxm5bCCa9OA). Most of the code coming from the video but it was still a great learning experience. I've changed the coding format to my style and changed the form aroound a bit. 

I didn't like how there was a background on the input boxes when typing in them . I decided to remove it and change the font color in order to be readable. 

The background was a bit bland so I decided to add an animated one. Using simple code to give it a moving gradient effect. 

There were others things I changed such as the <h2> tag in the form section and other small margin details for the links. 
  
I took this as an oppurtunity to learn and try something new. Diving into sign up formns and playing with the design in CSS. Picking up on new skills and now even having a template for future projects. I plan on learning more and hopping into JavaScript next. I ight even come back and play with this form more. 
  
Thank you for checking it out! 
  
Sincerly,
